2.0 Former Employee
Harvard Vanguard Medical Associates - Not recommended
Mar 24, 2011 
Pros - Up to an 8% match on the 401K
Cons - Lack of communication from upper management. Not given proper tools to perform job. Promotion of individuals to positions without poper education/training. Lack of honesty with positions (bait and switch) No clear vision of HVMA's direction for the future
Advice to Management - Just because someone has done a job for 10 years doesn't mean they should be promoted. Improved communications from upper management to rank and file employees. Remember that other people besides physicians work there. Hire the appropriate technical resources to maintain the infrastructure of the organization.

A Mission and Values Driven Organization
Aug 20, 2012 - Anonymous Employee
Pros - On the leading edge of the needed changes in health care.  Striving to be compassionate and to provide high quality care while keeping down costs.  A culture of teamwork and respect--where there is always something new to learn or to get involved in.
Cons - So much change can feel a bit overwhelming at times; priorities are not always clear.  Like many health care organizations, keeping fully staffed is a challenge.
Advice to Management - Building new habits takes time.  Help the organization embrace the concept of "go slow to go fast" in more situations.

Great Environment, Difficult to Advance
Jun 19, 2013 - Anonymous Employee
Pros - Wonderful people to work with, great benefits and fair salaries, if you have the right managers and administrators, HVMA is an excellent company to work for...
Cons - I think senior leadership is wasting resources on the wrong things. Also, it can be difficult to advance at a quick pace (in my field), despite excellent work.
Advice to Management - Seek out the talent in your organization! It's there.

3.0 Former Employee
Employees rewarded for increasing and decreasing the "right" numbers, as defined by administration.
Nov 24, 2013 
Pros - Fairly reasonable benefits and pay.
Cons - Administration's use of Toyota Lean techniques to supposedly improve various aspects of patient care, but which actually result in little improvement and which cause employees to be progressively overworked and under-rewarded.  Use of "360" job performance reviews, ie, being reviewed by coworkers, which leads to more morale issues.  Salaries based on "modified quota" system, in some departments, leading to decrease in pay when patients do not attend appointments.  Little support for frontline staff by management.
Advice to Management - See "Cons" above.  Focus on improving morale of and support for employees, and quality of care will improve as a result.  Decrease pay for upper management and increase pay for those at the bottom of the organizational chart.  Rethink the medical model.

Good mission statement, bad upper management.
Aug 8, 2014 - Supervisory 
Pros - Benefits were good. Pay was ok and the time off was acceptable as well.   All the major holidays were paid days off.
Cons - Upper management and administrators.  HVMA uses promotion from within as a big selling point but doesn't make good on the promise. I was an employee for well over a decade, denied a promotion I was more than qualified for, and my manager could not give me a good reason why.   From talking to other employees this is typical.
Advice to Management - Stop the revolving door of upper management. No one working on the front lines knows who upper management is or what any of you actually do. It always felt like there were too many of you.

Internal Medicine NP
Jul 26, 2022 - Nurse Practitioner
Pros - Wonderful support staff, 1:1 MAâ€™s. Unionized. Easy to get advice from specialist within Atrius quickly which helps get patients what they need while awaiting specialist appointments. Labs and X-ray on site at all locations, no weekends or holidays for IM. Staff are all very kind and patient focused. 20% admin time based on your FTE.
Cons - Increasing patient demands, with so many patient touch points that are all on you. Lacking enough nursing support so canâ€™t use them as much as would be ideal, job would be easier if I could off load more to them but they are seriously overwhelmed by calls and patient messages. Union is a positive and negative, can interfere with negotiations for yourself.
Advice to Management - Hire more nurses to support your clinicians. Set reasonable expectations for number of encounters per week. Complete market assessment to ensure competitive pay. Thank NPâ€™s for their flexibility.

Its Ok
Mar 22, 2023 - Medical Assistant in Concord, MA
Pros - Decent benefits, although if you want the most affordable health insurance option you MUST stay within Atrius Health for your care. Decent starting pay, higher than some multi- specialty healthcare facilities.
Cons - No sick time, you must use "earned time". Good luck trying to get a day off, always short staffed. No room for growth. Every few years they get bought out, each time its worse. During COVID we didn't see a raise or a contribution to our 401k because the company was in the red. Low morale, no incentive to do better. Zero appreciation from CEO all the way down to middle and lower management.
Advice to Management - Go back to the way things were 10 years ago.

Great first job out of NP school
Mar 26, 2023 - Nurse Practitioner 
Pros - internal transfer opportunities, the chance to learn from some very seasoned providers. Long ramp up, support from chief of my department.
Cons - pay isn't great, pressure to always see more patients and accomodate. As NP's still part of the union, but the structure of internal medicine dept means a lot of unpaid take home work.
Advice to Management - remove NP's from the union or pay them adequately, don't expect them to cover as many inbaskets without the same compensation their PA counterparts receive. Also midlevels shouldn't have same expectations for covering as PCPs.
